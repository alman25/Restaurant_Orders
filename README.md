### About this project
Uncovering Customer and Menu Insights Using SQL and Maven Analytics Data

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of restaurant order data using MySQL. The focus is on delivering key insights related to menu pricing, ordering behavior, and customer preferences, showcasing advanced SQL skills through structured queries and data exploration techniques.

### Two relational tables were used for this project:

- menu_items – contains item name, category, and price
- order_details – records all order transactions with date, time, and item references

The project is structured into three core analysis areas:

### 1. Menu Items Analysis
- Determine the total number of items on the menu
- Identify the most and least expensive items
- Highlight Italian cuisine availability and pricing
- Analyze pricing trends and item distribution by category

### 2. Order Analysis
- Identify the active date range of order data
- Count total orders and total items sold
- Pinpoint orders with the highest item quantities
- Assess how often large orders (12+ items) occur

### 3. Customer Behavior Analysis
- Join menu and order data to create a unified transactional view
- Determine the most and least ordered items and their categories
- Rank the top 5 highest-spending orders
- Explore detailed breakdowns of top-value orders
